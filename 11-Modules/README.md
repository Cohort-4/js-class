/**
 * Modules in JavaScript are reusable pieces of code that 
 * can be exported from one program and imported for use 
 * in another program.
 * Modules are particularly useful for a number of reasons. 
 * By separating code with similar logic into files called modules, we can:
 * find, fix, and debug code more easily;
 * reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of our application;
 * module.exports exports the module for use in another program.
 * require() imports the module for use in the current program.
 * 
 */



/**
 * ES6 (ES2015) introduced a more flexible, easier syntax to export modules:
 * 1. default exports use export default to export JavaScript objects, 
 * functions, and primitive data types.
 * 2. named exports use the export keyword to export data in variables.
 * 3. named exports can be aliased with the as keyword.
 * 4. import is a keyword that imports any object, function, or data type.

/**
 * To install npm package.json
 * we run `npm install packageName`
